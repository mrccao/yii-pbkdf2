Yii PBKDF2 String Hashing/Validation Component

## Installation

Copy the `Auth.php` file into your `protected/components` folder of your project.

In `config/main.php` add the following in the `components` array:

    'auth'=>array('class'=>'Auth'),

## Usage

### UserIdentity

In `protected/components/UserIdentity.php` you will need to modify your `authenticate` method

    public function authenticate()
    {
        $record=User::model()->findByAttributes(array('username'=>$this->username));
        
        if($record===null)
            $this->errorCode=self::ERROR_USERNAME_INVALID;
        else if(!Yii::app()->auth->validate_hash($this->password, $record->salt, $record->password))
            $this->errorCode=self::ERROR_PASSWORD_INVALID;
        else
            $this->_id = $record->id;
            $this->errorCode=self::ERROR_NONE;
        return !$this->errorCode;
    }

You will also need to override the `getId` method

    public function getId()
    {
        return $this->_id;
    }
	
And don't forget to declare `$_id` at the top of the class

    private $_id;

Refer to the Yii documentation for more on [authentication][1]

### Method calls

Always hash new passwords using the `generate_hash` method

    $auth = Yii::app()->auth->generate_hash('password');

This will return an object containing your new `salt` and password `hash` strings.
Store these values in your user table in your database for the user in question, for 
example when creating a new user or updating his password. **The salt must be updated
with the newly-generated salt each time.**

Validate a password using the `validate_hash` method

    $valid = Yii::app()->auth->validate_hash($raw, $salt, $hash);

Where `$raw` is the string authenticating against, `$salt` is the user's salt from 
your table, and `$hash` is the user's hashed password from your table.


## Configuration

You can override the default properties of the component in `config/main.php` as such

    'auth'=>array(
        'class'=>'Auth',
        'algorithm'=>'sha256',
        'iterations'=>2048,
        'salt_bytes'=>42,
        'hash_bytes'=>42,
    ),

**algorithm** - the [hashing algorithm][2] you want to use

**iterations** - choose at least 1000

**salt_bytes** - how large of a salt to generate. You should never alter this value once you
have begun generating password/salt combinations. A value of 24 produces a string of 32 characters.

**hash_bytes** - how large of a hash to generate. You should never alter this value once you
have begun generating password/salt combinations. A value of 24 produces a string of 32 characters.
